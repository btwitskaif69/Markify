> Create content that educates, engages, and converts readers into users.

---

## 1. Customer Journey Content

### Content by Stage

| Stage | Reader Intent | Content Type | Goal |
|-------|---------------|--------------|------|
| **Awareness** | "I have a problem" | Problem-focused posts, "Why" articles | Educate on the problem |
| **Consideration** | "What solutions exist?" | Comparisons, how-to guides, listicles | Show solutions |
| **Decision** | "Which one should I choose?" | Case studies, features, reviews | Convert to user |
| **Retention** | "How do I get more value?" | Tips, advanced guides, updates | Keep engaged |

### Topic Examples by Stage

| Stage | Example Topics for Bookmark Manager |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| **Awareness** | "Why You Keep Losing Important Links", "The Hidden Cost of Bookmark Chaos" |
| **Consideration** | "5 Ways to Organize Bookmarks", "Best Bookmark Managers 2025" |
| **Decision** | "Markify vs. Pocket: Which is Better?", "How Markify Saved Me 3 Hours/Week" |
| **Retention** | "10 Markify Features You're Not Using", "Advanced Tagging Strategies" |

---

## 2. Pain Point Mapping

### Finding Pain Points

| Source | How to Use |
|--------|------------|
| Reddit/forums | Search "[product category] frustrating" |
| Reviews of competitors | Look for 2-3 star reviews |
| Support tickets | Common complaints = content opportunities |
| Search queries | "how to [problem]" keywords |

### Pain Point → Content

| Pain Point | Content Angle |
|------------|---------------|
| "I can never find saved links" | "How to Find Any Bookmark in 5 Seconds" |
| "Too many browser tabs" | "Tab Hoarding? Here's How to Finally Close Them" |
| "Bookmarks sync doesn't work" | "Why Your Bookmarks Disappear + The Fix" |
| "Organizing takes too long" | "The 5-Minute Bookmark Organization System" |

---

## 3. Problem-Agitation-Solution (PAS)

### The Framework

| Phase | Purpose | Word Ratio |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Problem** | Name the pain they feel | ~20% |
| **Agitation** | Intensify the frustration | ~30% |
| **Solution** | Present your answer | ~50% |

### Example Application

**Problem:**
> "You've saved hundreds of bookmarks. Important articles, tools, resources. 
> But when you need one? You can't find it."

**Agitation:**
> "So you search. And search. 'Was it in that folder?' 'Did I tag it?' Ten 
> minutes later, you give up and Google it again—only to find the exact page 
> you already saved. Time wasted. Frustration mounting."

**Solution:**
> "There's a better way. Smart tagging + instant search means any bookmark 
> is 2 seconds away. Here's how..."

## 4. Value Proposition Writing

### Features → Benefits → Outcomes

| Layer | Question | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Feature** | What does it do? | "AI-powered auto-tagging" |
| **Benefit** | Why does that matter? | "Never manually organize again" |
| **Outcome** | How does life improve? | "Find any link instantly, save 3+ hours/month" |

### Value Statement Formula

> **[Outcome]** without **[pain point]**

Examples:
- "Find any bookmark instantly without endless scrolling"
- "Organize 1000+ links without lifting a finger"
- "Access your saved content anywhere without sync issues"

## 6. Strategic CTAs

### CTA Placement Strategy

| Position | CTA Type | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **After intro** | Soft, for ready buyers | "Already convinced? Try Markify free →" |
| **Mid-article** | Contextual to section | "Want to try this? Get started →" |
| **End of post** | Primary CTA | "Ready to organize your bookmarks? Start free today." |
| **Exit intent** | Last chance | "Don't leave with bookmark chaos—try Markify" |

### CTA Copy Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Specific** | "Start organizing" not "Get started" |
| **Benefit-led** | "Save time" not "Sign up" |
| **Low friction** | "Free, no credit card" |
| **Urgency (light)** | "Start today" |

---

## 7. Content Differentiation

### Stand Out in a Crowded Niche

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Original data** | Run surveys, share unique stats |
| **Personal experience** | "I tested X for 30 days..." |
| **Contrarian take** | Challenge common advice |
| **Depth** | Go deeper than competitors |
| **Freshness** | Most current info, "2025 update" |

### Competitive Angle

| If Competitors Say... | You Could Say... |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| "Organize your bookmarks" | "Stop organizing—let AI do it" |
| "Simple bookmark manager" | "The bookmark manager for power users" |
| "Free forever" | "Free tier that actually works" |

---

## 8. Content Metrics

### What to Measure

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Organic traffic** | SEO/discoverability working |
| **Time on page** | Content is engaging |
| **Bounce rate** | Relevance to search intent |
| **CTA clicks** | Content-to-conversion path |
| **Shares** | Content resonates emotionally |
| **Comments** | Audience engagement |

### Content Performance Tiers

| Performance | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| **Top 10%** (traffic) | Expand, create related content |
| **Growing** | Optimize, update, promote |
| **Flat** | Refresh, test new angles |
| **Declining** | Consolidate or redirect |

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Write about your product only | Write about their problems first |
| Hard-sell in every post | Educate, then soft-sell |
| Generic competitor comparisons | Honest, detailed analysis |
| Publish and forget | Update content regularly |
| One CTA fits all | Match CTA to content journey stage |

---

> **Remember:** Content marketing is a long game. Educate first, convert second. Trust leads to trials.
