# Blog Writer Skill

This skill provides a structured workflow for creating high-quality blog content that engages readers and ranks well in search engines.

## Writing Workflow

### Stage 1: Context Gathering (Before Writing)

**Ask these questions first:**

1. **Why?** - What is the purpose of this blog post?
   - Educate readers?
   - Drive traffic for SEO?
   - Establish thought leadership?
   - Announce a feature/product?

2. **Who?** - Who is the target audience?
   - Technical level (beginner/intermediate/expert)
   - What do they already know?
   - What problem are they trying to solve?

3. **What?** - What are the key takeaways?
   - What should readers learn?
   - What action should they take after reading?

**Do NOT start writing until these are clear.**

### Stage 2: Research & Structure

#### Keyword Research
Before writing, identify:
- Primary keyword (main topic)
- Secondary keywords (2-3 related terms)
- Long-tail keywords (specific phrases people search)

#### Create Outline
Structure every blog post with:

```markdown
# [Compelling Title with Primary Keyword]

## Introduction
- Hook (question, statistic, or bold statement)
- Problem statement (why reader should care)
- Promise (what they'll learn)

## [Main Section 1]
### Subsection if needed

## [Main Section 2]
### Subsection if needed

## [Main Section 3]
### Subsection if needed

## Conclusion
- Summary of key points
- Call to action

## FAQ (optional, great for SEO)
```

---

### Stage 3: Writing Guidelines

#### Voice & Tone
- **Conversational**: Write like you're explaining to a smart friend
- **Active voice**: "You can save bookmarks" not "Bookmarks can be saved"
- **Second person**: Use "you" and "your" to connect with readers
- **Confident but not arrogant**: Share expertise without being condescending

#### Structure Rules
- **Paragraphs**: Max 3-4 sentences each
- **Sentences**: Vary length, but keep most under 20 words
- **Subheadings**: Every 200-300 words (H2 for main sections, H3 for sub-points)
- **Lists**: Use bullets/numbers for 3+ related items
- **White space**: Let content breathe

#### Hook Formulas
1. **Question**: "Ever lost an important bookmark?"
2. **Statistic**: "The average person has 150+ bookmarks they never revisit."
3. **Bold statement**: "Your browser's bookmark manager is broken."
4. **Story**: "Last week, I spent 2 hours searching for a saved article..."
5. **Contradiction**: "More bookmarks doesn't mean more productivity."

#### Avoiding "AI Slop"
**DO NOT use these overused phrases:**
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "In conclusion..."
- "Without further ado..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "Game-changer"
- "Revolutionize"
- "Seamlessly"
- "Robust"
- "Leverage"

**Instead:**
- Be specific and concrete
- Use real examples and data
- Write like a human who cares about the topic

### Stage 4: SEO Optimization

#### Title Tag
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Keep under 60 characters
- Make it compelling (numbers, "How to", power words)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "7 Bookmark Organization Tips That Actually Work"
- ✅ "How to Never Lose a Bookmark Again (Step-by-Step)"
- ❌ "A Comprehensive Guide to Bookmark Management"

#### Meta Description
- 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword
- End with call-to-action or curiosity hook

#### Content Optimization
- Primary keyword in first 100 words
- Primary keyword in at least one H2
- Secondary keywords sprinkled naturally
- Internal links to related content (2-3 minimum)
- External links to authoritative sources (1-2)

#### Image Optimization
- Descriptive alt text with keywords
- Compressed file sizes (< 100KB for blog images)
- Relevant captions that add context

---

### Stage 5: Reader Testing (Self-Review)

Before publishing, simulate a reader's perspective:

1. **Scan test**: Can someone understand the main points in 30 seconds by reading headings and bold text?

2. **First paragraph test**: Does it clearly state what the article is about and why they should care?

3. **Value test**: Does every section provide actionable information or genuine insight?

4. **Question test**: What questions might a reader have? Are they answered?

5. **Action test**: Is there a clear next step for the reader?

### Stage 6: Quality Checklist

Before finalizing:

- [ ] Title includes primary keyword and is compelling
- [ ] Meta description is 150-160 chars with keyword
- [ ] Introduction has a strong hook
