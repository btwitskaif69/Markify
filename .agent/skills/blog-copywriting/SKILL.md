# Blog Copywriting

> Transform ideas into compelling blog content that captures and holds attention.

---

## 1. Headlines That Convert

### The 50-70 Character Rule

Headlines must work in search results AND capture attention.

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Number** | Creates structure expectation ("7 Ways...") |
| **Power word** | Triggers emotion (Ultimate, Essential, Proven) |
| **Benefit** | What reader gains (Save Time, Get Organized) |
| **Keyword** | SEO placement (front-load if possible) |

### Headline Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Number + Adjective + Noun + Benefit** | "7 Simple Chrome Extensions That Save Hours Weekly" |
| **How to + Outcome** | "How to Organize 1000+ Bookmarks in Under 10 Minutes" |
| **Question format** | "Still Losing Important Links? Here's the Fix" |
| **Negative angle** | "Stop Losing Bookmarks: The System That Actually Works" |

### Power Words by Emotion

| Emotion | Words |
|---------|-------|
| **Urgency** | Now, Today, Quick, Instant, Immediately |
| **Exclusivity** | Secret, Insider, Hidden, Little-known |
| **Value** | Free, Proven, Essential, Complete, Ultimate |
| **Trust** | Guaranteed, Research-backed, Expert, Tested |

---

## 2. Hooks That Capture

### The 8-Second Rule

You have ~8 seconds to hook a reader. Every hook must create a **curiosity gap**.

### Hook Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Pain Point** | Reader has a problem | "We've all been there—searching for that one important link you saved 'somewhere'..." |
| **Surprising Stat** | Data shock value | "The average knowledge worker loses 2.5 hours per week searching for saved content." |
| **Story** | Build connection | "Last Tuesday, I almost missed a deadline because I couldn't find a client's contract..." |
| **Question** | Engage curiosity | "What if you never lost a bookmark again?" |
| **Bold Claim** | Grab attention | "Your bookmark system is broken—and here's proof." |
| **Contrarian** | Challenge belief | "Folders don't work for bookmarks. Here's what does." |
| **Behind-Scenes** | Insider access | "After testing 47 bookmark managers, here's what actually matters." |
| **Confession** | Build trust | "I used to have 3,000 unorganized bookmarks. Here's how I fixed it." |

## 3. Blog Structure

### The Scannable Architecture

```
HEADLINE (H1)
├── Hook (first 2-3 sentences)
├── Promise (what reader will learn)
├── SECTION 1 (H2)
│   ├── Brief intro
│   ├── Key point (H3 if needed)
│   └── Example/proof
├── SECTION 2 (H2)
│   └── [same pattern]
├── SECTION 3 (H2)
│   └── [same pattern]
├── CONCLUSION
│   ├── Summary
│   └── CTA
└── FAQ (optional, great for SEO)
```

### Paragraph Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **2-4 sentences max** | Mobile readability |
| **One idea per paragraph** | Cognitive clarity |
| **Visual breaks every 300 words** | Prevent wall-of-text |
| **Lead with the point** | Scanners read first sentences |

### Scannability Elements

| Element | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| **Subheadings** | Every 200-300 words |
| **Bullet points** | Lists of 3+ items |
| **Bold text** | 1-2 key phrases per section |
| **Short sentences** | Mix 5-word and 15-word sentences |
| **White space** | Don't fear empty lines |

---

## 4. Reader Psychology

### Pain-Agitation-Solution (PAS)

| Phase | What to Do |
|-------|------------|
| **Pain** | Identify the problem clearly |
| **Agitation** | Make them feel the cost of inaction |
| **Solution** | Present your answer |

### AIDA for Blog Sections

| Element | Blog Application |
|---------|------------------|
| **Attention** | Hook + headline |
| **Interest** | Why this matters to them |
| **Desire** | Benefits + proof |
| **Action** | Clear CTA |

### Value Hierarchy

| Priority | Content Type |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Actionable steps they can use TODAY |
| 2 | Insights they haven't heard before |
| 3 | Data/research that supports claims |
| 4 | Stories that illustrate points |
| 5 | Background/context |

---

## 5. CTAs That Work

### CTA Placement

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **After intro** | Soft CTA for ready buyers |
| **Mid-article** | Natural break point |
| **End of article** | Primary CTA position |
| **Sidebar/sticky** | Always visible option |

### CTA Copy Formulas

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Benefit-led** | "Start organizing your bookmarks in 60 seconds" |
| **Curiosity-led** | "See why 10,000+ people switched" |
| **Action-led** | "Try Markify Free Today" |
| **Fear-of-missing** | "Don't lose another important link" |

## 6. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Start with "In today's digital world..." | Start with a hook |
| Bury the lead | Front-load value |
| Wall of text | Break up with formatting |
| Vague CTAs ("Click here") | Specific CTAs ("Get your free account") |
| Generic stock images | Relevant screenshots/graphics |
| End abruptly | Summarize + clear next step |

> **Remember:** Copywriting is about clarity, not cleverness. If a fifth-grader can't understand your point, simplify it.
