# Organic Voice

> Write like a human. Sound like a human. Because you're writing FOR humans.

---

## 1. The AI Detection Problem

AI-generated content has patterns that readers (and search engines) recognize:

| AI Pattern | Human Alternative |
|------------|-------------------|
| Perfect grammar always | Occasional fragments. Like this. |
| Formal, distant tone | Conversational, direct |
| Generic examples | Specific, personal experiences |
| Predictable structure | Varied rhythm and pacing |
| Neutral on everything | Strong opinions |

---

## 2. Banned Words & Phrases

### The AI Cliché List

These phrases scream "I'm AI-generated." **Never use them:**

| Category | Banned Phrases |
|----------|----------------|
| **Openers** | "In today's fast-paced world", "In the digital age", "As we all know" |
| **Transitions** | "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally", "It's worth noting" |
| **Intensifiers** | "Very unique", "Absolutely essential", "Truly remarkable" |
| **Conclusions** | "In conclusion", "To sum up", "All things considered" |
| **Filler** | "It goes without saying", "Needless to say", "At the end of the day" |
| **Buzzwords** | "Leverage", "Utilize", "Optimize", "Streamline", "Game-changer" |
| **Meta-phrases** | "This article will explore", "Let's dive in", "Without further ado" |

### Replace With

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "Leverage" | "Take advantage of" or just use the specific action |
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" |
| "It is important to note" | Just state the thing |

## 3. Human Writing Signals

### First-Person Voice

| ❌ AI-like | ✅ Human |
|-----------|----------|
| "One might find that..." | "I've found that..." |
| "Users often experience..." | "You've probably noticed..." |
| "It can be concluded..." | "Here's what I think..." |

### Contractions Are Your Friend

| Formal (AI-like) | Conversational (Human) |
|------------------|------------------------|
| "It is not" | "It isn't" or "It's not" |
| "You will find" | "You'll find" |
| "Do not" | "Don't" |
| "We are" | "We're" |

### Direct Address

Talk TO the reader, not ABOUT them:

| Distant | Direct |
|---------|--------|
| "Users can benefit from..." | "You'll benefit from..." |
| "One should consider..." | "Think about..." |
| "The reader may wonder..." | "You might be wondering..." |

---

## 4. Sentence Rhythm Variation

AI tends to write in predictable patterns. Break the rhythm.

### Mix Sentence Lengths

```
Short sentences punch. They create emphasis.

But then you'll want to add a longer sentence that flows a bit more 
naturally and gives the reader space to breathe.

See?
```

### Use Fragments Intentionally

Fragments aren't grammatical errors when used for effect:
- "The real problem? Nobody organizes bookmarks properly."
- "Worth it? Absolutely."
- "And yet."

### Start Sentences Differently

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Question** | "Ever lost a crucial link?" |
| **Statement** | "Bookmarks pile up fast." |
| **Conjunction** | "But here's the thing..." |
| **Personal** | "I tried everything." |
| **Command** | "Stop saving bookmarks to 'Read Later.'" |

---

## 5. Personality Injection

### Opinions and Stances

AI hedges. Humans take positions.

| AI Hedging | Human Opinion |
|------------|---------------|
| "Some might argue that..." | "Look, here's the truth:" |
| "There are various perspectives..." | "I've tested this. It works." |
| "It could be beneficial..." | "This is a game-changer." |

### Humor and Wit

Appropriate humor makes content memorable:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Self-deprecating** | "After losing my 47th important bookmark, I finally got serious." |
| **Exaggeration** | "Your browser probably has 83 tabs open right now. (Go ahead, count.)" |
| **Relatable** | "That folder labeled 'Important' from 2019? Yeah, I have one too." |

### Emotional Honesty

Share real feelings:
- Frustration: "This drove me crazy for months."
- Excitement: "When I finally figured this out..."
- Empathy: "I know how frustrating it is when..."

## 6. The "Show, Don't Tell" Principle

### Sensory and Specific Details

| Telling (AI) | Showing (Human) |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "It was frustrating." | "I spent 20 minutes scrolling through 'Saved Articles' trying to find that one recipe." |
| "The tool is easy to use." | "Three clicks. That's all it took." |
| "Users save time." | "What used to take me an hour now takes 5 minutes." |

### Concrete Examples Over Abstract Claims

| Abstract | Concrete |
|----------|----------|
| "Improves productivity" | "I found that client contract in 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes" |
| "Better organization" | "Every bookmark has a tag, and I can find anything by typing 2-3 words" |
| "Saves time" | "Saved me 3 hours last week—I actually tracked it" |

## 7. Anecdote Patterns

### Mini-Story Structure

1. **Setup** (1 sentence): What was the situation?
2. **Conflict** (1-2 sentences): What went wrong?
3. **Resolution** (1 sentence): How did it resolve?
4. **Lesson** (1 sentence): What's the takeaway?

### Example

> *Last week, a client asked for a resource I'd shared months ago. I panicked—
> that link was somewhere in my 2,000 bookmarks. Ten minutes later, I found it 
> (miracle). That's when I realized: hoping to "remember where" isn't a system.*

## 8. Voice Authenticity Checklist

### Before Publishing

- [ ] Read it aloud—does it sound like YOU talking?
- [ ] Search for banned phrases and remove them
- [ ] Check: At least 3 uses of "I" or personal experience
- [ ] Check: At least 5 uses of "you" (direct address)
- [ ] Are contractions used naturally?
- [ ] Is there at least one specific, personal example?
- [ ] Is there variance in sentence length?
- [ ] Does it have an opinion/stance (not just facts)?
- [ ] Would you actually say this to a friend?

### The Friend Test

> **Ask yourself:** "Would I say this if I were explaining it to a friend over coffee?"
> 
> If not, rewrite it until you would.

## 9. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Sound like a press release | Sound like a conversation |
| Use every synonym in the thesaurus | Repeat words naturally |
| Perfectly balance every sentence | Let some sections breathe, others punch |
| Stay neutral on everything | Take a stance |
| Use formal academic tone | Write like you're texting a smart friend |

---

> **Remember:** Perfect is the enemy of authentic. A few rough edges are proof of humanity.
