# Blog Post Templates Skill

A **blog post template** is a blueprint that guides you through crafting an engaging post. Use this skill to choose the right format and follow a proven structure.

## Quick Reference: Pick the Right Template

| Template | Best for | Primary outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **Beginner’s Guide** | Beginners/new-to-topic readers, customer success questions, introducing new concepts | Teach fundamentals with “what/why/how” and next steps |
| **Pillar (Cornerstone)** | Big evergreen topics, ranking for a core term + related terms, building topic clusters | A one-stop hub that links to related “cluster” posts |
| **Definition** | Informational intent (“What is X?”), quick answers + deeper explanation | Clear definition plus examples, misconceptions, and applications |
| **How‑To** | Step-by-step tasks, troubleshooting, skill-building | Actionable process readers can follow immediately |
| **Numbered Listicle** | Skimmable tips/rankings, curated resources, summarized research | Fast-to-consume points with variety + bonus value |

---

## Universal Workflow (Works for Every Template)

1. **Confirm intent & audience level** (beginner vs advanced).
2. **Pick one template** (don’t mix structures unless intentional).
3. **Draft the outline first** (headings + key points).
4. **Write to be skimmable** (short paragraphs, bullets, strong subheads).
5. **End with a clear next step** (resources, CTA, follow-up reading).

**Pro tip (optional):** If you use Semrush, set up **SEO Content Template** before writing. It can suggest keywords, metadata optimizations, and recommended article length before you draft.

# Template 1: Beginner’s Guide Blog Post

## When to use

- **Support customer success**: answer common questions and reduce support load.
- **Introduce a new concept/topic**: simplify complex ideas into steps.
- **Target beginners**: build a foundation for readers new to the subject.

## Anatomy

### 1) Craft a beginner-friendly title

- Clear, relatable language (avoid jargon).
- Include the **target keyword** naturally.
- Match **search intent** and signal “beginner” explicitly.

**Example pattern:** *Beginner’s Guide to [Topic]*

**Headline bank:**
- Kickstart Your Journey: A Novice’s Guide to Understanding [Concept]
- Decoding [Concept]: A Beginner’s Ultimate Guide
- Embark on [Concept]: A Clear, Simple Guide for Beginners
- Demystifying [Concept]: A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners

**Intro techniques:**
- **“Journey” teaser:** preview the steps/sections
- **Explain why:** practical importance
- **Relevance:** connect to reader goals

### 3) Create a concise guide of key concepts (the body)

Your body should include:
- Clear headers that don’t overwhelm beginners
- Easy-to-digest explanations of key concepts
- Actionable tips to apply concepts
- Any essential extra context a beginner needs

**Rule of thumb:** Cover the **what + why + how** for each concept so readers can return later when they’re stuck.

### 4) Provide next steps (the conclusion)

Reinforce value and tell readers what to do next:
- Key takeaways
- Links to deeper resources
- A CTA (e.g., “Click here to…”)

# Template 2: Pillar Blog Post (Pillar Page / Cornerstone Content)

## What it is

A **pillar post** is a large, comprehensive resource on a core topic. It acts as the hub for a **cluster** of related posts that link back to it, forming a content ecosystem.

## When to use

- High search demand for a niche-relevant topic (match user intent)
- You want to target one primary keyword **plus** many related keywords
- The topic is evergreen and will stay relevant over time

**Pro tip (optional):** Use Semrush **Topic Research** to uncover hundreds of subtopics, suggested headlines, and related questions—ideal for planning pillar pages and cluster content.

## Anatomy

### 1) Convey comprehensive coverage in the title

Pillar titles should promise “one-stop” depth.

**Example patterns:**

### 3) Thoroughly cover your topic and create clusters (body)

Include four key elements:

**Body rule:** cover all the questions/problems someone might have around the primary topic.

### 4) Satisfy readers (conclusion)

Your last chance to leave a strong impression:
- Make readers feel informed and inspired
- Consider a **FAQ section** to answer final questions

## 3 tips to consider

- **Choose the topic wisely:** broad enough for depth, not so broad it loses focus.
- **Update often:** add new cluster content/internal links and capture emerging keywords/trends.
- **Optimize strategically:** target related keywords and long-tail queries beyond the primary term.
